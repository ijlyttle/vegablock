Description: The Blocks website <https://bl.ocks.org> provides a way to share 
  JavaScript-based visualizations; the vegawidget package provides a way to 
  compose and render Vega (JavaScript) visualizations using R. This package 
  provides a bridge between the Blocks website and the vegawidget package. 
  If you have a GitHub account, you can use this package to deploy Vega(-Lite)
  blocks. Further, if a block contains a Vega(-Lite) specification and meets 
  a specific format, you can use this package to import such a specification.
