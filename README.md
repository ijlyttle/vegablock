vegablock
=========

The goal of vegablock is to provide an interface between Vega and
Blocks.

The Blocks website <https://bl.ocks.org> provides a way to share
JavaScript-based visualizations; the vegawidget package provides a way
to compose and render Vega (JavaScript) visualizations using R. This
package provides a bridge between the Blocks website and the vegawidget
package.

If you have a GitHub account, you can use this package to deploy
Vega(-Lite)blocks. Further, if a block contains a Vega(-Lite)
specification and meets a specific format, you can use this package to
import such a specification.

Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
