  - title: Creating and retrieving blocks
    desc: >
      Use these functions to create and retrieve [blocks](https://bl.ocks.org).
      The blocks service uses GitHub gists, so you will need a GitHub account,
      as well as a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
      (PAT). If you want to upload a preview image, you will need the
      [**webdriver**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=webdriver) package
      and PhantomJS.
